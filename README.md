# RODEClone

This is a clone of the home page of RODE: https://rode.com/en. It is a responsive website implementation using tailwind.

## Deployed link:
https://rode-clone-tailwind-res.netlify.app/

## Tech used:
- HTMLCSS
- Tail-wind

## Design:
- ResponsiveBreakpoints implemented for "md" which is 768px by default in tailwind
- Using tailwind CSS
- ION icons from https://ionic.io/ionicons


## Personal Notes:
- This is my first time using tailwind. I somehow prefer implementing CSS all by myself without Tailwind. The main reason is modular coding. I prefer to keep code modules segregated, I like CSS and HTML as separate files, and I like using classes and IDs to segregate elements. I also felt that in plain CSS I am able to control the elements with more detail compared to Tailwind. Tailwind felt like one large cluttered file. 
- As a habit, I first started implementing CSS for the bigger screens. I think this happens because I am implementing it on the laptop and I get to see the progress of the webpage on the laptop screen, so I tend to implement the webpage for the bigger screen. Hence, later when I was updating the HTML classes for smaller screens it was slightly challenging.
- I tried to implement the sticky menu which is not working right now. I am yet to debug this issue.

## TODO:
- Correct the sticky menu.
- Give proper hyper-links
- Implement animations wherever necessary
- improve finer details.

## Time-Taken:
8hours approx.
